# Using Blend Modes in Python

This project demonstrates using image [blend modes](https://pypi.org/project/blend-modes/) in Python.

To run this project, you must install the **pillow** and **blend-modes** packages.

## Demo 1

Demonstrates a foreground image blended onto a background image using the **multiply** blend mode. The two files are the same dimension.

## Demo 2

Similar to Demo 1 but the foreground image is smaller than the background image. The demo 2 file shows how to resize the foregound image to fit into the background image.
